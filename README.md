# FannieMae2018
I contributed to the Enterprise Data Lake (EDL) Project with Fannie Mae's Enterprise Data Infrastructure (EDI) teams in order to migrate the loan data from on-premise to the cloud. I was able to explore AWS technologies, develop primarily using Java, and engage in database management using Oracle, Netezza, and Aginity/Toad.
